# METHODS


## SEIR Model

We used a stochachastic SEIR (*Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered*) model to simulate transmission in population. We assumed a population size of 600,000, similar to the estimated population of the camps that make up the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. We chose to use only this population to limit assumptions needed about connectivity and mobility with other areas and to keep the modeled population as close to a closed population as possible. Furthermore the population size is relatively static and interaction with the broader population in Bangladesh is relatively limited. We assumed homogenous mixing and infection rates by age. Hospitalization, ICU admission, and death were estimated from the transmission model, and not explicitly included as states in the model (see *Severity* section below).

Transmissmission was defined by the $R_0$ and serial interval. Time from exposure to development of symptoms was defined by the incubation period ($\sigma$).  To capture a Ehrlang-distributed infectious period, we used $k=3$ compartments for the infecteds ($I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$). We assume transitions between compartments occur according to **Table S1**.

## Severity 

In a setting such as a refugee setting we assumed hospitalization will be limited to those who most require it, specifically severe cases. We assumed all hospitalization capacity available will be shifted for responding to COVID-19 severe cases, and no hospitalization for purposes of isolation will be done. Under these assumptions, proportion of infections resulting in severe disease approximate the proportion that will require hospitalization.

Age is currently the best defined predictor of severity due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with severity increasing exponentially with increasing age. To estimate the age-adjusted severity, we used data for a population of COVID-19 cases and contacts from Shenzhen, China [@bi_epidemiology_2020]. These data include the numbers of severe cases by 10-year age group from a total population of 391 individuals. With these data, we used the *rstanarm* package in *R* to run a Bayesian binomial model to estimate the probability of severe disease given infection and uncertainty bounds for each age group[@noauthor_bayesian_nodate, @noauthor_r_nodate]. 

Age distributions for countries were taken from the United Nations World Population Propects (https://population.un.org/wpp/) [@WPP]. We fit a spline to the reported age distribution for the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site (https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/myanmar_refugees) to estimate 10-year age proportions [@unhcr_data]. We used this population age distribution to weight the overall probability distribution of severity (Figure S3).
